Issues and solutions

1. warning sparseoptimizer::optimize " 0 vertices to optimize, maybe forgot to call initializeOptimization()" occurs during localbundleadjustment or localoptimize.

This warning is not caused by running two g2o optimizer at the same time, as I tested running hundreds of threads of g2o optimizers, no such warning occurs.

2. Add sigmaLevel0 for pixels at level 0

3. Add covariance estimates for optimized poses

4. Use anchored inverse depth parameterization for world points

5. Add monocular inertial SLAM

Issues and solutions
1. in stereo + imu and stereo configuration, testing on KITTI seq 00, the memory slowly is chipped away, and finally blocks loop closure and chokes the tracking thread

This happens with static or shared libraries of viso2, debug or release mode. I suspect it is caused by too many keyframes are stored in memory. But this does not happen with monocular ORB SLAM on KITTI seq 00.

2. in monocular configuration, testing on KITTI seq 00, many loop closures are not applied. 

Solution: Make sure the Orbslam_dwo, DBoW2, Viso2 are linked to the same set of OpenCV libraries. In the case of using ROS, find_package(OpenCV required) in CMakeLists.txt, otherwise, add OpenCV libraries path and include path, and library names in CMakeLists.txt.

3. warning sparseoptimizer::optimize " 0 vertices to optimize, maybe forgot to call initializeOptimization()" occurs during localbundleadjustment or localoptimize.

This warning is not caused by running two g2o optimizer at the same time, as I tested running hundreds of threads of g2o optimizers, no such warning occurs.

4. Add sigmaLevel0 for pixels at level 0

5. Add covariance estimates for optimized poses

6. Use anchored inverse depth parameterization for world points
